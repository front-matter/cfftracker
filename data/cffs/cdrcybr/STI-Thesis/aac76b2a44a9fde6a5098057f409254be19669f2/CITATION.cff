abstract: >-
  Every day is a Zero-day for unsupported operating
  systems. Computer operating systems are the
  foundation on which the  cyber-connected world is
  built. These operating systems often continue to be
  used long after the vendor has stopped providing
  free security updates, resulting in operating
  systems with a constantly increasing number of
  unpatched vulnerabilities. The lifecycle of Windows
  operating system is well understood thanks to
  Microsoftâ€™s efforts to migrate users to newer
  operating systems, however, the lifecycle of Linux
  operating systems used in many consumer products
  and the Internet of Things is not as well known.
  This whitepaper will quantify the risk of
  unsupported operating systems, with a focus on the
  Ubuntu operating system, to provide decision makers
  with the information needed to decide among the
  options of paying for extended support, updating to
  a supported operating system, implementing
  available mitigations, or simply accepting the
  risks.
